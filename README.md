## Description
- Sport  is  a  great  outlet  for  many  people  to  be  regularly  active  and  create  lasting  social connections. It can get people working together and push them to constantly work on improving themselves  both  physically  and  mentally.  However,  it  can  often  be  difficult  for  some  to regularly  participate  in  sporting activities.Many  sports  require  the  coordination  of  multiple participants, the appropriate equipment,and facilities, and in some cases a similar ability among players for an enjoyable experience.  Managing all these aspects just to begin playing can be overwhelming, and as a result,many people are unable to play sports as a regular part of their schedule. 

- We  propose  that  an  application  tohelp  eliminate  the  hassle  of  organizing  casual  sporting activitieswould be an immediately impactful tool for a large variety of people. By providing a space to hostand navigate pick-up sporting events, this application would allow users to easily find players of a similar skill level to join them in whatever sport they are interested in playing. This would be accompanied by features that promote the discovery of events happening locally for each user, and those that help build communities of inclusive and communicative players.
